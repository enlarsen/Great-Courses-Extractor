Great Courses Extractor
=======================

I wanted something that would automatically add metadata to video files ripped
from Great Courses DVDs (thegreatcourses.com) so I wouldn't have to do it by hand. 
After all, each course is made up of a ridiculous number of video files.

## To use:

1. Find the course page on thegreatcourses.com
2. Copy and paste the URL into the app
3. Click "Scrape"
4. Wait for the table to populate
5. Click on "Add to files"
6. Shift click the files, making sure they are in increasing order.
7. Go!

## Metadata Added

- Series title (lecture name)
- Artist (lecturer's name)
- Video type (TV Show)
- Genre (Non Fiction)
- Episode number (lecture #)
- Season number (1)
- Description and long description
